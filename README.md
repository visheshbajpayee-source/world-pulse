# 🌍 WorldPulse — A Real-Time Global Explorer Dashboard

> **Intern Project | Full-Stack Frontend Challenge**
> *Stack: HTML5 · CSS3 · Vanilla JavaScript · Free Public APIs*

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**WorldPulse** is a real-time, interactive global explorer dashboard that lets users search any country and instantly see its weather, latest news headlines, public holidays, and a random fun fact — all beautifully laid out in a responsive, animated UI.

This project is intentionally designed to force you to use **every major concept** across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No libraries. No frameworks. Pure vanilla stack.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, interns will have practiced and demonstrated mastery of:

### 🧱 HTML5
- Semantic document structure (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`)
- Forms and input elements with proper `label` associations
- `data-*` custom attributes
- Accessibility: ARIA labels, roles, and `tabindex`
- Meta tags for SEO and Open Graph
- Linking external fonts (Google Fonts) and stylesheets
- Image handling with `alt` text and `loading="lazy"`
- `<template>` elements for cloning dynamic content
- `<dialog>` element for modals

### 🎨 CSS3
- CSS Custom Properties (variables) for a complete design system
- Flexbox layouts (navbar, cards, footers)
- CSS Grid layouts (dashboard panel arrangement)
- Responsive design with media queries (mobile → tablet → desktop)
- CSS animations (`@keyframes`) — loading spinners, card reveals, shimmer skeletons
- Transitions and hover effects on interactive elements
- Pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) for decorative effects
- CSS `clamp()` for fluid typography
- `:root` theming and dark/light mode toggle via class switching
- `backdrop-filter`, `box-shadow`, and `border-radius` for glassmorphism cards
- `position: sticky` navbar
- CSS Grid `auto-fill` / `auto-fit` for the news cards section
- Scroll-based behavior using `scroll-behavior: smooth`

### ⚡ JavaScript (ES6+)
- `fetch()` API and `async/await` for all API calls
- `Promise.all()` to fire multiple API calls in parallel
- Error handling with `try/catch/finally`
- DOM manipulation: `querySelector`, `createElement`, `appendChild`, `innerHTML`
- Event listeners: `click`, `keydown`, `input`, `change`
- Debouncing the search input field (manual implementation — no lodash)
- `localStorage` for persisting the last searched country and dark/light mode preference
- `sessionStorage` for caching API responses within the session
- JavaScript modules (`import` / `export`) — split code into logical files
- `Intl.DateTimeFormat` and `Intl.NumberFormat` for locale-aware formatting
- Array methods: `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, `.find()`, `.sort()`
- Destructuring, spread operator, optional chaining (`?.`), and nullish coalescing (`??`)
- Template literals for building dynamic HTML strings
- The `IntersectionObserver` API for lazy-loading news cards as the user scrolls
- `AbortController` to cancel in-flight fetch requests when a new search is made
- Custom event dispatching with `CustomEvent`

## 🖥️ Feature Requirements

### 1. 🔍 Country Search Bar
- A search input with real-time debounced suggestions (wait 400ms after user stops typing)
- Show a dropdown of matching country names using REST Countries API
- Pressing `Enter` or clicking a suggestion triggers a full dashboard load
- Cancel any previous pending request using `AbortController`

### 2. 🗺️ Country Info Panel
- Display: Flag (SVG), Country Name, Capital, Region, Population (formatted with `Intl`), Currency, Languages, Timezones
- Use `data-*` attributes on the card elements
- Animate the panel in using a CSS keyframe on load

### 3. 🌤️ Weather Widget
- Use the country's capital's coordinates (from REST Countries) to call Open-Meteo
- Display: Current temperature, wind speed, weather condition code mapped to a human-readable label and SVG icon
- Show a 3-day forecast strip

### 4. 📰 News Feed
- Fetch top 6 headlines for the country using GNews
- Render as cards in a CSS Grid
- Implement `IntersectionObserver` so cards animate in as they scroll into view
- Each card: headline, source, published date (formatted), and a "Read More" link

### 5. 🗓️ Upcoming Public Holidays
- Fetch the current year's public holidays for the country
- Filter and display only the next 3 upcoming holidays
- If a holiday is today, highlight it with a special badge

### 6. 💡 Fun Fact Widget
- Fetch a random fun fact from API Ninjas on every search
- Add a "Get Another Fact" button that fetches a new one without re-searching

### 7. 🌙 Dark / Light Mode Toggle
- A toggle button in the navbar
- Switches a `.dark` class on `<body>` and updates all CSS variables
- Saves the preference to `localStorage` and loads it on next visit

### 8. 📜 Search History
- Store the last 5 searched countries in `localStorage`
- Show them as clickable chips below the search bar
- Allow clearing the history
